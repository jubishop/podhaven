      <title>The Pentagon’s Press Purge</title>
      <description>As the Pentagon implements sweeping new restrictions on press access, Jon is joined by Atlantic staff writer Nancy Youssef, War Horse founder Thomas Brennan, and former Pentagon spokesperson and retired Marine Corps Colonel David Lapan. Together, they examine why many journalists vacated the Pentagon and refused to sign on to these rules, explore the realities of military reporting from inside and outside the Pentagon, and discuss what’s at stake when a trillion-dollar institution responsible for millions of American lives becomes even more opaque and unaccountable.

      <title>The Republican Playbook: Democrat Edition with Tim Miller and David Faris</title>
      <description>As the government shutdown takes effect, Jon is joined by Roosevelt University Professor and contributing writer at The Nation David Faris, and "The Bulwark Podcast" host Tim Miller to examine Democratic strategy. Together, they explore what Democrats are hoping to achieve through the shutdown, discuss whether the party should rethink its resistance tactics and policy priorities, and consider what it would look like if Democrats embraced the hardball precedents Trump and Republicans have set when they eventually return to power.

Together, they explore how algorithms distort the way we experience these tragic events while rewarding the most extreme reactions, investigate the online ecosystems that can radicalize individuals, and consider whether our responses to violence perpetuate the very cycles we condemn.

      <title>All the President’s Tools</title>
      <description>As Trump's pressure campaigns target universities, media outlets, and private companies, Jon is joined by former US Attorney Preet Bharara, host of "Stay Tuned with Preet," and Dan Pfeiffer, co-host of "Pod Save America" and author of "Message Box." Together, they examine the tools available to presidents to coerce independent institutions, explore the loopholes in our democratic guardrails that enable such pressure, and consider whether a future Democratic administration could—or should—repair the vulnerabilities Trump is exploiting or use them for its own purposes.

      <title>Iran, Beyond the Headlines with Maziar Bahari</title>
      <description>With the US now directly engaged in the Israel-Iran conflict, Jon is joined by Maziar Bahari, publisher of iranwire.com and author of “Then They Came for Me,” a memoir that served as the basis for Jon’s 2014 film “Rosewater.” Together, they explore the reality of life under Iran's current government, discuss the complex challenges of regime change both in Iran and elsewhere, and consider what ordinary Iranians actually want: peace and the freedom to live their lives.

      <title>Israel, Iran and Trump’s Incompetence</title>
      <description>Amid growing fears about where the Israel-Iran conflict leads, Jon is joined by Ben Rhodes, co-host of "Pod Save the World" and former Deputy National Security Advisor, and Christiane Amanpour, CNN's Chief International Anchor and host of "Christiane and The Ex Files with Jamie Rubin." Together, they trace the complex history that brought us to this moment, examine Trump's response to the escalation, and explore why achieving peace remains far more challenging than waging war.

      <title>Why We Can’t Have Nice Things with Ezra Klein</title>
      <description>As Democrats struggle to define the future they want to create, we're joined by Ezra Klein, host of The New York Times podcast "The Ezra Klein Show" and co-author of "Abundance," to examine why turning progressive visions into reality has become so difficult. We explore how good intentions have created obstacles, how empowering officials can streamline government, and what could be achieved without bureaucratic constraints.

      <title>America's Factory Reset with Adam Tooze and Sohrab Ahmari</title>
      <description>As the Trump administration pursues a dramatic economic realignment, we're joined by Adam Tooze, author of Chartbook on Substack, and Sohrab Ahmari, US Editor of UnHerd and author of Tyranny, Inc., to examine the feasibility and implications of an American industrial revival. We analyze the administration's strategy for reshoring manufacturing, debate whether reversing globalization is possible or desirable, and consider what economic nationalism would accomplish for a workforce that has largely moved beyond factory jobs.

      <title>Agreeing &amp; Disagreeing with Jen Psaki</title>
      <description>As Democrats grapple with defining their principles and message, we're joined by Jen Psaki, host of MSNBC's "Inside with Jen Psaki" and "The Blueprint with Jen Psaki" podcast. Also drawing on her political experience, including as White House Press Secretary under Biden, we discuss who is (or isn't) shaping Democratic policy, how media can better cut through noise to inform the public, and the core values that should guide the party’s future.

      <title>JON &amp; AOC</title>
      <description>As Trump returns to the White House, backed by a coalition of billionaires and blue-collar workers alike, we’re joined by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). Together, we confront the growing disconnect between Democrats and their working class roots, discuss strategies for advancing progressive priorities in a resistant Congress, and explore what it would take to rebuild a party that actually delivers for working people.

      <title>History (and Trump) Repeats with Jon Meacham</title>
      <description>As America braces for a second Trump administration, we're joined by historian Jon Meacham to place our current moment within the broader sweep of U.S. history. Together, we examine whether Trump's explicit rhetoric about territorial expansion and open billionaire support truly represents something unprecedented, reflect on how the Biden administration might be remembered, and consider what patterns from our past tell us about America's future.

Together we explore his foray into the political arena as a surrogate for Kamala Harris, his mission to disrupt America's healthcare system, and ways government might harness AI to tackle the country’s most entrenched problems. Plus, Mark gives Jon a lesson in crypto.

      <title>Man Oh Man: Why Male Voters Shifted Right</title>
      <description>In the weeks following the election, Democrats are confronting uncomfortable questions as to why much of the electorate—particularly men—abandoned the Left. This week, we're joined by Richard Reeves, President of the American Institute for Boys and Men, and Annie Lowrey, staff writer at The Atlantic. Together, we examine how the party might speak to both modern men and women, and bridge the gap between aspirational rhetoric and practical achievements.

Together, we examine how the party might speak to both modern men and women, and bridge the gap between aspirational rhetoric and practical achievements.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Follow The Weekly Show with Jon Stewart on social media for more: </p><p>&gt; YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@weeklyshowpodcast">https://www.youtube.com/@weeklyshowpodcast</a></p><p>&gt; Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/weeklyshowpodcast">https://www.instagram.com/weeklyshowpodcast</a></p><p>&gt; TikTok: <a href="https://tiktok.com/@weeklyshowpodcast">https://tiktok.com/@weeklyshowpodcast</a> </p><p>&gt; X: <a href="https://x.com/weeklyshowpod">https://x.com/weeklyshowpod</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Host/Executive Producer – Jon Stewart</p><p>Executive Producer – James Dixon</p><p>Executive Producer – Chris McShane</p><p>Executive Producer – Caity Gray</p><p>Lead Producer – Lauren Walker</p><p>Producer – Brittany Mehmedovic</p><p>Video Editor &amp; Engineer – Rob Vitolo</p><p>Audio Editor &amp; Engineer – Nicole Boyce</p><p>Researcher &amp; Associate Producer – Gillian Spear</p><p>Music by Hansdle Hsu</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>—</p><p>This podcast is brought to you by:</p><p>ZipRecruiter</p><p>Try it for free at this exclusive web address: <a href="http://ziprecruiter.com/ZipWeekly">ziprecruiter.com/ZipWeekly</a></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Left Behind: Why Democrats Lost the Working Class</title>
      <description>As Democrats try to understand their eroding support among working-class voters, we're joined by Sarah Smarsh, author of "Bone of the Bone: Essays on America by a Daughter of the Working Class.” Together, we delve into the intersection of class and identity, discuss why the Democrats' appeals to working people have fallen short, and consider how progressive politics might rebuild its relationship with working-class communities.

      <title>Trump 2024: The Patriotism Paradox</title>
      <description>With less than a week until the election, Americans face a stark choice about their country's future. While Trump's supporters wave flags from the Revolutionary War — a war fought against a king —Trump seeks to expand presidential authority and claim immunity from wrongdoing. This week, we're joined by Mona Charen, Policy Editor at The Bulwark and host of "Beg to Differ" podcast, and Harvard Professor Emeritus Laurence H. Tribe, to explore Trump's shallow patriotism and his disregard for the very Constitution he could once again swear to preserve, protect and defend.

      <title>Pay Pals: How Billionaires Influence Elections</title>
      <description>Money in politics isn't new, but billionaire influence in our elections has reached staggering levels – and 2024 could break all previous election spending records. From the presidential race to down ballot elections and think tanks to media empires, wealthy donors are reshaping American democracy in ways voters rarely see. Joining us to follow the money trail are New York Times reporters Teddy Schleifer and Ken Vogel, who help us explore how the ultra-wealthy leverage their resources across the political landscape and what they expect in return.

      <title>MAGA Mirage: Trump &amp; Vance’s Contradictory Conservatism</title>
      <description>You’ve heard the Republican ticket’s pro-worker rhetoric. It often contradicts their own actions and party ideology, but is representative of an emerging faction within the right wing. Joining us to explore this new conservative ideology are Oren Cass, Chief Economist at American Compass, and Zachary Carter, author of "The Price of Peace: Money, Democracy, and the Life of John Maynard Keynes." Together, we delve into key policy battlegrounds, from labor rights and immigration to domestic manufacturing and trade. Plus, the group considers a Post-Trump Republican Party.

      <title>How Algorithms, Money, &amp; Bureaucracy Distance us from Democracy</title>
      <description>With the election just over a month away, Americans are caught between a flood of political promises and the reality that we live in a time of political dysfunction. Joining us this week to explore the root causes are Ezra Klein, opinion columnist at The New York Times, host of "The Ezra Klein Show" podcast, and author of "Why We're Polarized," alongside Tristan Harris, co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology and co-host of "Your Undivided Attention" podcast. We examine how engagement-driven metrics and algorithms shape public discourse, fueling demagoguery and widening the gap between political rhetoric and public needs.

      <title>Spilling Election Tea with London Mayor Sadiq Khan</title>
      <description>As world leaders descend upon NYC for the UN General Assembly, London Mayor Sadiq Khan joins us to discuss the parallel challenges facing the UK and US. The conversation dives into both countries’ elections, explores the impacts of misinformation, immigration, and populism, and examines the responsibilities of the media and politicians to educate and inform. Later, Stephanie Kelton, Economics Professor at Stony Brook University and author of "The Deficit Myth," offers a fresh perspective on our previous episode, challenging conventional wisdom about government spending and deficits.

      <title>Inflation Frustration as Fed Cuts Rates</title>
      <description>Inflation has eased, but many Americans aren’t feeling the relief. Their concern is front and center this election, where the economy remains the pivotal issue for voters. As the Federal Reserve cuts rates this week, we delve into competing views on the root causes of recent price surges, the Fed's response to those surges, and the effects of demand-side vs. supply-side stimulus on the American economy. Joining us for a lively conversation are Kitty Richards, Senior Fellow at Groundwork Collaborative and Former Treasury Official, and Jason Furman, Aetna Professor of the Practice of Economic Policy at Harvard University.

      <title>The Second First Presidential Debate and Beyond</title>
      <description>In an election cycle where debates have been more impactful than ever, what influence has the first, and perhaps only, meeting between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump had on voters? To unpack the debate and its implications for each campaign, we’re joined by Ashley Parker, Senior National Political Correspondent for The Washington Post, and David Graham, staff writer at The Atlantic. Together, we explore how debate formats constrain real messaging, which candidates gained or lost ground, and, of course, where the campaigns go from here.

        <![CDATA[<p>In an election cycle where debates have been more impactful than ever, what influence has the first, and perhaps only, meeting between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump had on voters? To unpack the debate and its implications for each campaign, we’re joined by Ashley Parker, Senior National Political Correspondent for The Washington Post, and David Graham, staff writer at The Atlantic. Together, we explore how debate formats constrain real messaging, which candidates gained or lost ground, and, of course, where the campaigns go from here.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Follow The Weekly Show with Jon Stewart on social media for more: </p><p>&gt; YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@weeklyshowpodcast">https://www.youtube.com/@weeklyshowpodcast</a></p><p>&gt; Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/weeklyshowpodcast">https://www.instagram.com/weeklyshowpodcast</a></p><p>&gt; TikTok: <a href="https://tiktok.com/@weeklyshowpodcast">https://tiktok.com/@weeklyshowpodcast</a> </p><p>&gt; X: <a href="https://x.com/weeklyshowpod">https://x.com/weeklyshowpod</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Host/Executive Producer – Jon Stewart</p><p>Executive Producer – James Dixon</p><p>Executive Producer – Chris McShane</p><p>Executive Producer – Caity Gray</p><p>Lead Producer – Lauren Walker</p><p>Producer – Brittany Mehmedovic</p><p>Video Editor &amp; Engineer – Rob Vitolo</p><p>Audio Editor &amp; Engineer – Nicole Boyce</p><p>Researcher/Associate Producer – Gillian Spear</p><p>Music by Hansdle Hsu</p><p><br></p><p>—</p><p>This podcast is brought to you by:</p><p>ZipRecruiter</p><p>Try it for free at this exclusive web address: <a href="http://ziprecruiter.com/ZipWeekly">ziprecruiter.com/ZipWeekly</a></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Political Conventions: At This Point, What’s The Point?</title>
      <description>The Democratic National Convention is in full swing, but what influence does it have on the election? Once a hotbed of debate, drama, and actual decision-making, the DNC has transformed into a carefully choreographed media event where political insiders pretend to decide things they've already decided. So what are we doing here? This week, we dive into these questions with Zolan Kanno-Youngs, White House Correspondent with the New York Times and CNN political analyst, and Jill Lepore, Professor of History and Law at Harvard, staff writer at The New Yorker, and author of "The Deadline." Together, we discuss the happenings on the floor, explore how these political gatherings have evolved from smoke-filled rooms of party bosses to the spectacles of today, and examine how political messaging has adapted (or failed to adapt) to the ever-changing media landscape.

      <title>The Harris/Walz are Closing In! with Senator Amy Klobuchar</title>
      <description>In a matter of weeks, the Democrats have unveiled a new ticket – injecting fresh energy into a presidential race once considered a foregone conclusion. Who better to illuminate this shift than Senator Amy Klobuchar, who ran against Vice President Harris for President in 2020, served alongside her in the Senate, and represents Minnesota just like Governor Walz? This week, we dive into the Democratic Party's seismic change, and explore the intricacies of VP selection and vetting. Drawing from her unique experience, Senator Klobuchar offers insights into the challenges women face in high-profile campaigns, the urban-rural divide in American politics, and the art of passing crucial legislation in a gridlocked Washington. Jon and the Senator also look ahead to the Democratic National Convention, campaign season, and beyond. No denial of service attack will stop this conversation from happening!

      <title>Trump, Vance, and The Republican Anti-Worker Playbook</title>
      <description>The right-wing talks a big economic populist game, claiming that the working class is their chief concern. But their pro-worker words don’t translate into pro-worker actions. During the first Trump administration, for instance, Republicans killed raising the minimum wage and created a higher threshold for workers to be eligible for overtime pay. Plus, Trump’s Supreme Court justice selections represent the most anti-worker judges in a century. This week, we’re joined by Steven Greenhouse, the labor and workplace reporter at the New York Times for 19 years, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, and author of the book, Beaten Down, Worked Up: The Past, Present, and Future of American Labor, as well as Heather Cox Richardson, author of Democracy Awakening: Notes on the State of America. Together, they examine the history of labor in the US and explore what populist rhetoric offers Americans when it's accompanied by policies that undermine workers.

      <title>Biden Out, Harris In: A Media Disasterpiece</title>
      <description>In the turbulent month since President Biden’s disastrous debate performance, the media has been speculating as to whether it was probable, or even possible, for him to drop out of the race. Turns out, it was both. In light of Biden’s historic decision, how effectively did the media guide the public through the election chaos? This week, helping us to contextualize the moment and understand the challenges in covering it, we’re joined by Doris Kearns Goodwin, presidential historian and Pulitzer Prize-winning author, whose most recent book is “An Unfinished Love Story: A Personal History of the 1960s", as well as Eugene Daniels, POLITICO White House correspondent and Playbook co-author. Together, they examine the flaws in our electoral process and media coverage, offer some possible fixes, and provide facts —not speculation — about what to expect in the weeks ahead.

      <title>Trump Assassination Attempt Aftermath with Bill O’Reilly</title>
      <description>It has been a few days since the attempted assassination of former President Trump. Both sides in our polarized political system have retreated to their respective corners and cast blame on the other, making it more difficult than ever to engage in healthy debate with political adversaries. Joining us to do just that is Bill O’Reilly, Anchor of No Spin News and Author of the upcoming book, Confronting the Presidents: No Spin Assessments from Washington to Biden.

      <title>Biden 2024: It Is What It Is?</title>
      <description>After a lackluster debate performance, calls are mounting for President Biden to drop out of the 2024 race. Yet, he insists he is still running. Is this the right move? Joining us to explore our current conundrum, we’re joined by Jon Favreau and Tommy Vietor, Founders of Crooked Media, hosts of Pod Save America and Authors of Democracy or else: How to Save America in 10 Easy Steps, as well as Bakari Sellers, CNN political commentator and Author of The Moment. Together, they hash out the best path forward for Democrats to defeat Trump this election and save democracy.

      <title>Two-Party System: Third Parties Need Not Apply</title>
      <description>The first presidential debate is here, and voters do not seem thrilled with the two, very different candidates. How does a consumerist country built on choice produce so few options? This week, helping us to understand our two party system and why third parties don’t work within it, we’re joined by Max Stearns, Law Professor at University of Maryland Carey School of Law, and the author of “Parliamentary America: The Least Radical Means of Radically Repairing Our Broken Democracy,” as well as Sam Rosenfeld, Associate Professor of Political Science at Colgate University, and the co-author, with Daniel Schlozman, of “The Hollow Parties: The Many Pasts and Disordered Present of American Party Politics.” Together, they help us to understand the flaws in how our current system functions and offer some possible remedies going forward.

      <title>Abortion: Mission Impossible</title>
      <description>The media may have you believe that the recent Supreme Court decision on Mifepristone was a win for reproductive rights. In reality, it merely upheld the current status quo – a drastic departure from the standard once set by Roe. And an onslaught of challenges, aimed at making abortion impossible, if not illegal, are on the horizon. Joining us to explore this regression we have Melissa Murray, NYU Law Professor and co-host of the Strict Scrutiny Podcast, and Jessica Valenti, founder of AbortionEveryDay.com and author of the forthcoming book, Abortion: Our Bodies, Their Lies, and the Truths We Use to Win. Together, they discuss how our distorted democracy brought us to this moment, unpack the backward slide of abortion rights in America, and offer tips on what we can do to counter this trend.

      <title>The Military Industrial Complexity</title>
      <description>On the 80th anniversary of D-Day, we reflect on how the US military saved democracy from fascism. This week, as the Senate marks up next year’s defense spending bill, Jon sits down with Bill Hartung of the Quincy Institute and Roxana Tiron of Bloomberg to investigate whether our arsenal is still bolstering democracy, both abroad and at home. From the active conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza to our rivalry with China, we explore the efficacy of U.S. strategy. Plus, we dive deep into the ballooning defense budget and discuss Jon’s attempts to shine a light on it all.

        <![CDATA[<p>On the 80th anniversary of D-Day, we reflect on how the US military saved democracy from fascism. This week, as the Senate marks up next year’s defense spending bill, Jon sits down with Bill Hartung of the Quincy Institute and Roxana Tiron of Bloomberg to investigate whether our arsenal is still bolstering democracy, both abroad and at home. From the active conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza to our rivalry with China, we explore the efficacy of U.S. strategy. Plus, we dive deep into the ballooning defense budget and discuss Jon’s attempts to shine a light on it all. </p><p>And you can also check out the tax tool shared with us by a resourceful listener here:</p><p><a href="https://us.abalancingact.com/2023-federal-taxpayer-receipt">https://us.abalancingact.com/2023-federal-taxpayer-receipt</a></p><p><br></p><p>Follow The Weekly Show with Jon Stewart on social media for more: </p><p> </p><p>&gt; YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@weeklyshowpodcast">https://www.youtube.com/@weeklyshowpodcast</a> </p><p>&gt; Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/weeklyshowpodcast">https://www.instagram.com/weeklyshowpodcast</a></p><p>&gt; TikTok: <a href="https://tiktok.com/@weeklyshowpodcast">https://tiktok.com/@weeklyshowpodcast</a> </p><p>&gt; X: <a href="https://x.com/weeklyshowpod">https://x.com/weeklyshowpod</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>CREDITS</p><p>Host/Executive Producer – Jon Stewart</p><p>Executive Producer - James Dixon</p><p>Executive Producer – Chris McShane</p><p>Executive Producer – Caity Gray</p><p>Lead Producer – Lauren Walker</p><p>Producer – Brittany Mehmedovic</p><p>Video Editor &amp; Engineer - Rob Vitolo</p><p>Audio Editor&amp; Engineer Nicole Boyce</p><p>Researcher - Catherine Nouhan</p><p>Music by Hansdle Hsu</p><p><br></p><p>—</p><p>This podcast is brought to you by:</p><p>ZipRecruiter</p><p>Try it for free at this exclusive web address: <a href="http://ziprecruiter.com/ZipWeekly">ziprecruiter.com/ZipWeekly</a></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Democracy Under Threat: The Soft Hum of Corruption</title>
      <description>Despite what cable news may have you believe, Donald Trump is not the sole threat to our democracy. This week, we’re peeling back the rhetoric and taking a look at where the vulnerabilities in our institutions lie. In conversation with Jane Mayer, Chief Washington Correspondent for The New Yorker magazine and Noah Bookbinder, President of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, Jon explores the roots of our democratic dysfunction. From ever-multiplying dark money to shark tanking ideas for tax transparency, this episode has it all. Plus, hear from producers of the pod and get a taste for what you can expect in episodes to come!

Fact Check: Jane Mayer mentions that Jon said the FEC is about as useless as male nipples. It was, in fact, Jordan Klepper who said this.
