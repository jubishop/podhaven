              "What if you could capture an entire world with just a few hundred photos—and step inside it?\nIn this episode of Reshaping Workflows, host Logan Lawler talks with Michael Rubloff, founder of RadianceFields.com, about how radiance fields, Gaussian splatting, and AI technologies are transforming the way we capture, simulate, and interact with the physical world.\nMichael breaks down what radiance fields are, how they evolved from NeRFs (Neural Radiance Fields), and why Gaussian splatting is accelerating real-time 3D reconstructions. They also dive into real-world use cases—from construction site documentation to autonomous vehicle simulation—and how accessible tools, consumer devices, and Dell Pro Max hardware are making high-fidelity 3D capture possible for anyone.\nWhether you’re in architecture, e-commerce, industrial design, or creative media, this conversation will reshape how you think about the future of imaging, simulation, and 3D workflows.\nTune in and discover how the next frontier of visualization is already here.\nYou can also watch this and all previous episodes here.\nFollow Us\nLinkedIn @DellTechnologiesTwitter @DellTechYouTube @DellTechnologiesLinkedIn @NVIDIATwitter @NVIDIAInstagram @NVIDIAFacebook @NVIDIAPresented by Dell and NVIDIA\nhttps://www.dell.com/precisionai\nhttps://www.dell.com/dellpromax\nhttps://www.dell.com/nvidia-ai",

A whole new way of storytelling.\nIn this episode of Reshaping Workflows, host Logan Lawler sits down with Ben Saltzman, filmmaker and creator of the AI-driven video game Glimmer. They explore how Ben transitioned from a career in media and entertainment to building narrative-driven, generative games without a technical background.\nBen shares how he taught himself Python, leveraged AI tools like Claude, Midjourney, and Klein, and moved from costly cloud workflows to developing locally on a Dell Precision 7875 workstation with multiple LLMs running in parallel. He also discusses how AI accelerates creativity, reduces busywork, and enables indie creators to build complex, character-rich experiences that used to require massive teams and budgets.\nFrom launching passion projects like Quill Quest to building reactive NPCs in Glimmer, Ben proves that storytelling is being redefined by accessible hardware and intelligent tools.\nTune in to hear how powerful AI and Dell Precision are reshaping what’s possible for creators—one idea, sprint, and simulation at a time.\nYou can also watch this and all previous episodes here.\nFollow Us\nLinkedIn @DellTechnologiesTwitter @DellTechYouTube @DellTechnologiesLinkedIn @NVIDIATwitter @NVIDIAInstagram @NVIDIAFacebook @NVIDIAPresented by Dell and NVIDIA\nhttps://www.dell.com/precisionai\nhttps://www.dell.com/dellpromax\nhttps://www.dell.com/nvidia-ai",

              "What happens when you open up mental health data to the global data science community? In this episode, host Logan Lawler talks with Gregory Kiar and Arianna Zuanazzi from the Child Mind Institute about a recent Kaggle competition that explored how physical health metrics—like sleep and activity—can predict problematic internet use in kids and teens.\nGreg, a research scientist and director of the Center for Data Analytics, Innovation, and Rigor, shares how they handle messy, real-world data to generate insights that matter. Arianna, who leads open science and data collaboration efforts, explains why involving people outside of academia leads to better questions and better science. They break down the competition structure, the surprising role of sleep data, and why overfitting results can lead to real-world consequences. They also talk about the challenges of working with human-generated data, and how competitions like this inform future research and care.\nYou can also watch this and all previous episodes here.\nFollow Us\nLinkedIn @DellTechnologiesTwitter @DellTechYouTube @DellTechnologiesLinkedIn @NVIDIATwitter @NVIDIAInstagram @NVIDIAFacebook @NVIDIAPresented by Dell and NVIDIA\nhttps://www.dell.com/precisionai\nhttps://www.dell.com/dellpromax\nhttps://www.dell.com/nvidia-ai",

              "Getting started with AI doesn’t have to be overwhelming. In this episode, host Logan Lawler is joined by Sama Bali, Head of AI Solutions Product Marketing at NVIDIA, for a deep dive into how NVIDIA’s NIM microservices are helping developers—from enterprise teams to solo coders—bring AI into their applications with less friction.\nThey explore what NIMs are, how they work, and why they’re especially useful for teams without dedicated AI engineers. Sama explains how developers can test and deploy NIMs using Dell Pro Max systems, how tools like AI Workbench and AI Blueprints support faster prototyping, and what types of real-world projects are already being powered by NIMs—from retail to healthcare to weather forecasting.\nWhether you're an IT decision maker, software engineer, or just starting to explore AI tools, this episode offers a practical overview of how to build smarter with less overhead.\nFollow Us\nLinkedIn @DellTechnologiesTwitter @DellTechYouTube @DellTechnologiesLinkedIn @NVIDIATwitter @NVIDIAInstagram @NVIDIAFacebook @NVIDIAPresented by Dell and NVIDIA\nwww.Dell.com\nwww.NVIDIA.com",
