		<description><![CDATA[<p>We called up some economists to get their take on one word to describe this year&#8217;s economy. Mostly, experts said things fell somewhere in the middle of excellent and disastrous, but some had cheerier outlooks than others. Also in this episode, we ring in the new year with a 2025 housing market lookahead and a breakdown of the first congestion pricing program in the U.S., coming to New York City Jan. 5.</p>

In this episode, we explain why those workers&#8217; wages may rise anyway — a concept called the Baumol effect — with help from an economist who&#8217;s also an amateur bassoonist. Plus, the trade deficit is no sweat, a Georgia program trains refugees for tech jobs and we check in with an urban tour guide in Kansas City.</p>

But financial advisers caution against assuming you&#8217;ll get lucky — half of the &#8220;great wealth transfer&#8221; will come from just the top 2% of households. Also in this episode: Insurance grows pricier, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau limits bank overdraft fees and less than 10% of Americans moved last year — the lowest proportion since the Census Bureau began keeping track in 1948.</p>

A caravan of red trucks snakes through picturesque towns, delivering holiday cheer in the form of good old-fashioned Coke. The company just released a new version, meant to invoke nostalgia for the Yule of yesteryear. And in the true spirit of 2024, it&#8217;s AI-generated. Will all our ads be AI-made soon? Or is human creativity still key? Also in this episode: A dogecoin influencer weighs his options, a startup wants to put EV chargers in lampposts and unit labor costs may tell us where inflation is headed.</p>

    <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>Back-to-back Hurricanes Helene and Milton caused billions in damage. How are insurers going to pay for it all? Turns out, insurance companies have their own insurance. But as disasters get more severe and more frequent, &#8220;reinsurance&#8221; isn&#8217;t covering what it used to. Also in this episode: Boeing has major catch-up to do, an abandoned oil field could become a lithium extraction hotspot, and small businesses seem hesitant to cut health benefits.</p>
